## How to Log Your Time

You track time in a Google Sheet. The app reads from it.

**In your Google Sheet:**
- Column A: Start time (like "9am" or "2:30pm")
- Column B: What you did + tags

**Example:**
```
9am    | Answered emails. Work
10:30  | Team meeting. Work, Important
12pm   | Lunch break. Rest
```

**Tags you can use:**
- **Work** - Job tasks
- **Necessity** - Must-do things (errands, chores)
- **Soul** - Things that feed your spirit (hobbies, learning)
- **Rest** - Relaxation and sleep
- **Waste** - Time you wish you'd spent differently

You can also add:
- **Important** - Tasks that matter for your goals
- **Urgent** - Tasks with deadlines

## Understanding Your Dashboard

### The Main Chart (Pie Chart)

Shows how your time splits across the 5 categories.

- **Work** = Blue
- **Necessity** = Orange  
- **Soul** = Purple
- **Rest** = Green
- **Waste** = Red

Bigger slices = more time spent there.

### The Priority Matrix (4 Boxes)

This shows tasks by urgency and importance:

- **Top Left (Q1)** - Urgent AND Important (crises, deadlines)
- **Top Right (Q2)** - Important but NOT Urgent (planning, growth)
- **Bottom Left (Q3)** - Urgent but NOT Important (interruptions)
- **Bottom Right (Q4)** - Neither urgent nor important

**Goal:** Spend more time in Q2 (important, not urgent). This is where you grow.

### The Week View (7 Circles)

Shows how many hours you logged each day this week.

- Bigger circle = more hours logged
- Click any day to see that day's details

---

## How to Use the App

### Viewing Different Time Periods

At the top, you'll see three buttons:
- **Day** - See just today
- **Week** - See this whole week
- **Month** - See this whole month

Click any button to switch views.

### Seeing Task Details

Click on any:
- Slice of the pie chart
- Box in the priority matrix  
- Day circle in the week view

A popup will show all tasks in that category.

### Refreshing Your Data

Click the **Sync** button (top right) to pull the latest data from your Google Sheet.

## Tips for Success

### 1. Log as you go
Update your sheet throughout the day. It's easier than remembering everything later.

### 2. Be honest with tags
If you spent time on social media, tag it "Waste" if that's true for you. No judgment - just awareness.

### 3. Review weekly
Look at your week view every Sunday. Notice patterns. Adjust next week.

### 4. Aim for balance
You don't need to eliminate all "Waste" time. Rest matters. Balance matters.

### 5. Focus on Q2
Try to spend more time on "Important but not Urgent" tasks. This is where real progress happens.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to track every minute?**  
No. Track blocks of time. "9am to 11am: Deep work. Work, Important" is fine.

**Q: What if I forget to log something?**  
Just add it later. The app reads from your sheet, so you can always edit.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**  
Yes! The app works on any device with a web browser.

**Q: What if I don't have a Google Sheet?**  
You can set one up for free. Or use the app's CSV import feature to upload data directly.

**Q: How often does the app sync?**  
Automatically every 5 minutes. You can also click "Sync" to update immediately.

## Remember

This app is a tool for **awareness**, not judgment.

The goal isn't perfection. It's understanding.

When you see how you spend time, you can make better choices.

Small changes add up.

You've got this. 🌟
